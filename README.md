## Instructions
Move the black hole: Mouse

Change size of the black hole: Scroll

Objects are attracted to the black hole, but capsules and Earth will perish if they pass the event horizon for too long. Sun is not affected by the black hole but grows in mass and gravitational force as objects collide with it. Game over when Earth collides with Sun or there are no astronauts left on earth.
